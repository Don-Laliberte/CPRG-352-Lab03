# CPRG-352-Lab03
 This repo contains one of my Labs from my Web Dev course at SAIT. This one involved an Age calculator based on entered birthday. Application runs off JSP servlets and although old, was still pretty cool to do.
# What I learned
•Basic JSP servlet implementation
•Server attributes and parameters
